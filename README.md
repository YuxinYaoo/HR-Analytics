# HR Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset to uncover trends and insights into employee attrition. The dataset includes features such as employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and performance metrics, providing a comprehensive view of the factors that contribute to attrition. 

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data). It contains 1,470 rows and 35 columns, representing various attributes of employees and their attrition status.

### Key Features
- **Attrition**: Whether an employee has left the company.
- **Age, Gender, Marital Status**: Demographic information.
- **JobRole, Department**: Professional details.
- **MonthlyIncome, JobSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance**: Job satisfaction metrics.
- **PerformanceRating, OverTime**: Performance and workload indicators.

## Project Objectives
- Explore and visualize the dataset to identify patterns in employee attrition.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers.
- Build machine learning models to predict employee attrition.
- Provide actionable recommendations for improving employee retention.


## Features and Highlights
### Data Exploration
- Detailed analysis of attrition trends by demographics, job roles, and satisfaction levels.
- Visualization of key factors influencing attrition.

### Machine Learning Models
- **Decision Tree**: Built as a simple baseline model for predicting attrition.
- **Bagging**: Improved model stability and reduced variance using ensemble techniques.
- **Random Forest**: Leveraged multiple decision trees for better generalization.
- **AdaBoost**: Enhanced model performance by focusing on misclassified instances.
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Used gradient-based optimization for robust predictions.
- **XGBoost**: Achieved high accuracy and performance with advanced boosting techniques.


### Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 86.96% in predicting employee attrition using the Gradient Boosting Classifier model.


## Key Findings and Recommendations
- Employees with poor work-life balance and low job satisfaction are more likely to leave.
- Flexible work hours and reduced overtime may improve retention.
- Regular feedback and performance reviews are critical for maintaining employee satisfaction.
